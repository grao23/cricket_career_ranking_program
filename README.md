# cricket_career_ranking_program
Input the stats of a player in TEST match cricket and the program will out the players' rankings with a respective score alongside it. 

There are 3 different types of "positions in cricket"

- Bowler
- Batsman
- All-rounder (one who can equally bowl and bat)

  There are 3 different formats(types) of cricket:

  - Test match cricket (Takes place over 5 days, 90 overs a day)
  - ODI cricket (50 overs for each side, One Day match)
  - T20 cricket(20 overs for each side, shortest format)

Each code file is listed in the format of (position_format_grades) for accessibility and to make it easier to find. 

Using that code I ran it through a spreadsheet of data that I collected and used that to output a grade for every test batter, as well as printing a top 10 best TEST batters of all time list.
